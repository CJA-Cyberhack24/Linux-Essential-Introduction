## 🧭 Why I Chose Linux

My exploration into Linux began during the Google IT Support certification. At first glance, Linux seemed barebones—no flashy GUI, mostly command-line interface (CLI)—and I assumed that meant "basic." But the more I used it, the more I realized how powerful and efficient it is. Its stability, flexibility, and open-source nature won me over.

Despite being around for decades, Linux felt like a hidden gem, and diving into its ecosystem has been one of the most rewarding tech experiences I’ve had so far.

## 📚 What’s Next?

I’m now exploring shell scripting, deeper file permission management, and dabbling with server deployment using Linux. The learning curve is real—but incredibly exciting!
