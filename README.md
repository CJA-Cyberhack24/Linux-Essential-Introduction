## - 🐧 Linux’s Emergence


* **1983:** Richard Stallman initiates the GNU Project with the goal of creating a free and open-source Unix-like operating system.
* **1991:** Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, begins working on his own hobby operating system kernel, dissatisfied with MINIX. He announces it on a Usenet group.
* **1991** (September): Torvalds releases the first version of the Linux kernel (0.01).
* **1992:** The Linux kernel is re-licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), making it truly free and open source and allowing collaboration with GNU tools.
* **Early 1990s:** The "Linux distribution" concept emerges, combining the Linux kernel with GNU utilities and other software (e.g., SLS, Yggdrasil Linux).
* **1993:** Debian project is founded, focusing on a community-driven, stable distribution.
* **1994:** Red Hat Software and SUSE (among the earliest commercial Linux companies) are founded.
* **1996:** The Tux penguin is adopted as the official mascot of Linux.
* **1990s (Late):** Linux gains significant traction in the server market, especially for web servers (LAMP stack).
* **1999:** KDE and GNOME desktop environments mature, making Linux more user-friendly for desktop use.
* **2004:** Ubuntu is first released, quickly becoming one of the most popular and accessible desktop Linux distributions.
* **2000s onwards:** Linux continues to dominate the server, supercomputing, and embedded device markets (routers, smart TVs, Android phones, IoT devices).
* **2010s onwards:** Cloud computing heavily relies on Linux. Docker and Kubernetes (containerization technologies) become prevalent, often running on Linux. Microsoft introduces features like WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), acknowledging Linux's importance.

## 🧭 Why I Chose Linux

My exploration into Linux began during the Google IT Support certification. At first glance, Linux seemed barebones—no flashy GUI, mostly command-line interface (CLI)—and I assumed that meant "basic." But the more I used it, the more I realized how powerful and efficient it is. Its stability, flexibility, and open-source nature won me over.

Despite being around for decades, Linux felt like a hidden gem, and diving into its ecosystem has been one of the most rewarding tech experiences I’ve had so far.

## 🛠️ First Commands I Learned

Here’s a cheat sheet I created that helped me build my foundation:

> 📌 *This image summarizes the essential commands I started with, like `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cat`, and others that helped me manage files, navigate the system, and understand permissions.*

## 📚 What’s Next?

I’m now exploring shell scripting, deeper file permission management, and dabbling with server deployment using Linux. The learning curve is real—but incredibly exciting!
