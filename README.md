* **1991:** Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, begins working on his own hobby operating system kernel, dissatisfied with MINIX. He announces it on a Usenet group.
* **1991** (September): Torvalds releases the first version of the Linux kernel (0.01).
* **1992:** The Linux kernel is re-licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), making it truly free and open source and allowing collaboration with GNU tools.
* **Early 1990s:** The "Linux distribution" concept emerges, combining the Linux kernel with GNU utilities and other software (e.g., SLS, Yggdrasil Linux).
* **1993:** Debian project is founded, focusing on a community-driven, stable distribution.
* **1994:** Red Hat Software and SUSE (among the earliest commercial Linux companies) are founded.
* **1996:** The Tux penguin is adopted as the official mascot of Linux.
* **1990s (Late):** Linux gains significant traction in the server market, especially for web servers (LAMP stack).
* **1999:** KDE and GNOME desktop environments mature, making Linux more user-friendly for desktop use.
* **2004:** Ubuntu is first released, quickly becoming one of the most popular and accessible desktop Linux distributions.
* **2000s onwards:** Linux continues to dominate the server, supercomputing, and embedded device markets (routers, smart TVs, Android phones, IoT devices).
* **2010s onwards:** Cloud computing heavily relies on Linux. Docker and Kubernetes (containerization technologies) become prevalent, often running on Linux. Microsoft introduces features like WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), acknowledging Linux's importance.
